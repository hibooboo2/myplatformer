# My Game

The goal here is to be an exploration of sdl2 using go bindings to test out how to build a basic 2d game.

## Goals

    - [ ] Make a world that never ends
        - [ ] World is actually just proceduraly generated.
        - [ ] Walk in any direction and it just makes more world as you go. But remembers it
        - [ ] Be able to customize how the map generates per run with some flags/ vars
        - [ ] Top down perspective.
        - [ ] Allow objects to be interactive. (Open doors, close open chests etc..)
